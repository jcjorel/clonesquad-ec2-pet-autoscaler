# cs-instance-watcher

**Purpose:** Optimize EC2 instance draining mode handling CloneSquad is used without TargetGroup.

This daemon is to install and run on EC2 instances part of a CloneSquad group.

This scripts allows to react on instance state change from the CloneSquad point of view. 

> Without usage of `cs-instance-watcher`, **in a TargetGroup free usage and with a front-end external Load-Balancer**, 
users could see latencies, timeouts or sharp disconnections due to draining instances shutdown abruptly.

Even the tool is designed to track and possibly react to any state transition, it is 
meant to react especially to the 'draining' state:
When no TargetGroup is used, a possible use-case is that a load-balancer (different 
from an AWS ALB/NLB/CLB) is serving CloneSquad managed instances.

In order to help non-AWS Load-Balancer detects the draining instance condition, the
`cs-instance-watcher` daemon contains a pre-built algorithm that reject all new TCP connections
toward a user-supplied list of ports while allowing the current established ones to continue.
The external load-balancer health-checks will thus fail as soon as the instance
falls in the 'draining' state allowing a smooth redirection toward other serving
instances without user noticing the event.

Users can also decide to write their own logic for reacting to 'draining' state (See [Configuration](#Configuration)).


## Installation

Pre-requisites:

* Run as root (if use of the builtin port blacklisting feature),
* collect the port(s) to blacklist on 'draining' instance condition (if use of the builtin port blacklisting feature),
* Install Python3 and the packages `requests`, `requests-iamauth` and `boto3`.

	python3 -m pip install requests requests-iamauth boto3

1) Copy the tool file [here](../tools/cs-instance-watcher) to the EC2 instance.
	* The tool do not need the DevKit and only need the packages listed in the pre-requisistes.
2) Run the tool with appropriate arguments.

**Example:**

The following lines could be part of the EC2 Instance user-data to install once and run the tool at every start automatically.

	# Download the tool
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcjorel/clonesquad-ec2-pet-autoscaler/master/tools/cs-instance-watcher -o /usr/local/sbin/cs-instance-watcher
	chmod a+x /usr/local/sbin/cs-instance-watcher
	# Create a systemd service for the tool that will blacklit por t80 and 442 on 'draining' condition.
	/usr/local/sbin/cs-instance-watcher --on-draining-block-new-connections-to-ports 80 443 --log-file /var/log/cs-instance-watcher.log --log-file-rotate d,1,10 --generate-systemd /etc/systemd/system/cs-instance-watcher.service
	# Start the instance watcher ready to block ports 80 and 443 if the instance is placed in draining state
	systemctl enable cs-instance-watcher
	systemctl start cs-instance-watcher


### Configuration

The tool takes command line arguments:

	usage: cs-instance-watcher [-h] [--api-polling-period [API_POLLING_PERIOD]]
	                          [--on-draining-block-new-connections-to-ports [ON_DRAINING_BLOCK_NEW_CONNECTIONS_TO_PORTS [ON_DRAINING_BLOCK_NEW_CONNECTIONS_TO_PORTS ...]]]
	                          [--config [CONFIG]] [--script-dir [SCRIPT_DIR]]
	                          [--instance-state [INSTANCE_STATE]]
	                          [--stale-context-timeout [STALE_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT]]
	                          [--force [FORCE]] [--log-file [LOG_FILE]]
	                          [--log-file-rotate [LOG_FILE_ROTATE]]
	                          [--generate-systemd [GENERATE_SYSTEMD]]
	                          [--do-not-generate-systemd [DO_NOT_GENERATE_SYSTEMD]]

**Arguments:**

* `--api-polling-period <seconds>`: Period between call to the CloneSquad API GW to get instance status (`running`, `draining`...). Default: `10`
* `--on-draining-block-new-connections-to-ports <port> <port>`: Activate the builtin algorithm which forbids new TCP connections to the specified ports on `draining`condition. Default: `None`
* `--stale-context-timeout <seconds>`: Period of time where the tool used cached data about the running instance (Tags especially). Default: `300`
* `--log-file <path_to_a_file>`: Path to the rotated log file Default: `stderr`
* `--log-file-rotate log_rotate_spec`: Log rotation specification. Format: TimeUnit,RotationPerTimeUnit,BackupFileCount. Default: `d,1,7`
* `--generate-systemd <systemd_service_file>`: Path to a systemd service configuration file to create.
* `--script-dir <directory>: A directory containing scripts to launch on state change. Default: /etc/cs-instance-watcher.d/
	* Place scripts under a subdirectory which hold the name of the state.

Ex: 

	/etc/cs-instance-watcher.d/draining/script_to_launch_on_draining.sh
