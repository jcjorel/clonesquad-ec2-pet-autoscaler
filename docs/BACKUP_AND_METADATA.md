# Backup and Metadata

CloneSquad comes with configuration **backup** and **metadata** export capabilities.

* The backup feature aims to avoid accidental loss of DynamoDB table contents ('CloneSquad-{GroupName}-Configuration' and 'CloneSquad-{GroupName}-Scheduler' ones)
* The Metadata feature can be used to build a centralized CMDB-like to gain easy insights of numerous CloneSquad deployments among an AWS Organization (i.e. multi-account environment).
